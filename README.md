# CoH2: Battlegrounds tuning

## Development

_**IMPORTANT:**_ Before opening the tuning mod with the mod editor, change the UCS file encoding to `UTF-16 LE` (most text editors can do this). This is only really needed if working with locale stuff. Remember to change the encoding back to `UTF-8` before pushing to the repository.

Any changes made in the tuning mod are not detected automatically by the app (but still work ingame). You will need to run the [Battlegrounds console tool](https://github.com/BattlegroundsCoH/coh-battlegrounds/wiki/Battlegrounds-Console-Tool#database-tool).
